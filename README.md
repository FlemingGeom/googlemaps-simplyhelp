# Geom99 - Explore Google Maps 

## Welcome and Instructions

Congratulations on loading the repository for Week 1 and 2 in Geom101. You will find associated starter files here and instructions how to proceed in the D2L checklist titled [Week 1 and 2 Checklist: Google Maps](https://fleming.desire2learn.com/d2l/lms/checklist/viewchecklist.d2l?checklistId=11564&ou=165911)

## Before you begin

The repository you have loaded does not have "GitHub Pages" enabled yet. You must do this yourself now by:

1. Click the `Settings` icon, near the top-right side of the GitHub window
2. Scroll to the bottom and look for `Pages` entry in the left selection, click it. 
3. Under `Source: Branch`, select `Main`. Leave the other settings as Root
4. Click `Save` to commit this. 

Now your repository will be accessible under GitHub Pages (an HTML Web Server) at [](https://fleminggeom.github.io/googlemaps-[username]) where `[username]` is your GitHub account username.

## Activities to complete

In this repository you will need to create content in this repository from the following activities:

- [ ] Google MyMaps Sharkspotters tutorial. 
- [ ] Maps - Simple HTML Map Example
- [ ] Routes - Directions API - URL request JSON response
- [ ] Modify Dynamic Map Clustering example to show Ontario Parks
- [ ] Be creative using the requirements

> Optional Tip: You can check the above boxes by editing this MarkDown document and adding an `x` between the `[ ]`, like this: `[x]`

## Due date

Please individually complete all items listed in the D2L checklist _before_ the indicated due date. Many items will be checked at the start of your lab in Week 3 and if not complete will be graded as a 0/incomplete. 

## Classroom Provided API Key 

Google Maps is a pay-per-use service and requires a valid API Key to function. Whenever the documentation asks for a key you can use one of the two available here. There are two types of keys available this year:

### Referral from FlemingGeom GitHub Classrooms (URL links from web pages). 

A referral is the address of the web page where a someone clicked the link that sent them to the page (in this case the various Google API's). The repository URL works only with the GitHub Classrooms environment. The URL must be exactly `fleminggeom.github.io/googlemaps-[username]`, where `[username]` is replaced with your actual GitHub account's username.

### Whitelisted IP Address

Some items (like Directions API) do not accept Referrals and are meant to be used server-side (aka locally on your computer). To provide access here a second key is provided that is restricted only by the IP address of the calling computer. This key will work on the Fleming VDI or (optionally, if your computer IP is provided during your first scheduled lab) on your local computer. 

_Both keys are provided within the Geom99 D2L Checklist and are restricted to provide access to only the following on Google Cloud:_

_Directions API, Distance Matrix API, Geocoding API, Geolocation API, Maps Elevation API, Maps Embed API, Maps JavaScript API, Maps Static API, Places API, Roads API, Street View Static API, Time Zone API_

_The API Keys you must use are provided at the beginning of this checklist. It is not recommended to create your own account and keys without first consulting with the instructor._
